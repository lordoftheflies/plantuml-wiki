**TITLE**: Frequently Asked Questions about installation

**DESC**: This pages lists some very common questions about the installation of PlantUML. Please read it first before sending us mail or asking your question on the forum.

====== Installation notes ======

===== Sequence Diagram =====

First, you should focus only on **Sequence Diagrams**. Even if you are not interested in sequence diagrams, since they are working without Graphviz, it is somehow simplier to let them work. And if they do not work, __other diagrams will probably also not work__.

You should then test **Sequence Diagrams** using the command line, and not in the target tool you want to install (Eclipse, Word, Mediawiki...) :

    java -jar plantuml.jar -verbose sequenceDiagram.txt

In the ''sequenceDiagram.txt'' file, you can have a very simple test:

    @startuml
    Alice -> Bob: test
    @enduml

The ''-verbose'' flag is used to generated some logs that you can send to us, if no image is generated.

Under Unix, you must have X11 librairies installed (which is done by default). Otherwise, you will have some [[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/headless-136834.html|HeadlessException]].
You may have to add a flag ''-Djava.awt.headless=true'' in the [[command-line|command line]]. 

If this is working, but not in your tool, it is probably due to a specific tool issue:

On MediaWiki & Windows, you must set the read & execute permissions on ''C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe'' for the account the PHP web service extension is running under. PHP needs those permissions to "fork" other processes.


===== Others Diagrams =====

Once sequence diagrams are working fine, you can focus on others diagrams.

If Graphviz is not installed on your system, you have to [[graphviz-dot|install it first]].

Under Linux, try to launch ''dot'' command into a command shell. You //may// have to finalize the installation by typing ''dot -C''.

[[graphviz-dot|You may have to set GRAPHVIZ_DOT]] variables if you have not chosen the default installation directory of Graphviz.

To test the installation of Graphviz, you can use the command line:
    java -jar plantuml.jar -testdot

You can also use this special diagram description:

    @startuml
    testdot
    @enduml

Once again, you should test using the command line and the ''-verbose'' flag:

    java -jar plantuml.jar -verbose classDiagram.txt

The ''classDiagram.txt'' file can be very simple:

    @startuml
    A <|-- B
    @enduml

If you still have issues, then you can [[mailto:plantuml@gmail.com|send us a mail]].
