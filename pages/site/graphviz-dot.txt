**TITLE**: Test your GraphViz installation

**DESC**: This page gives information about testing your GraphViz installation for PlantUML. It lists some basic checks and some actions to be taken in case of failure.

To be able to generate some diagrams, you must have Graphviz software installed on your machine.

====== Important note about version ======

**PlantUML** should be working with any version of Graphviz, starting with **2.26.3**

The following versions have been tested, and are known to work:

  * 2.26.3
  * 2.28
  * 2.30.1
  * 2.34
  * 2.36
  * 2.38

However, it is possible that some cases with some versions have issues.

If you compile Graphviz by yourself, you have to build it with //libexpat// in order to work with PlantUML.

If you find something wrong, thanks for [[mailto:plantuml@gmail.com|sending us a note]] or posting a message [[http://forum.plantuml.net|on the forum]].

====== Default ======

By default, the dot executable should be:

  * Windows :
    * Firstly in: ''c:\Program Files\Graphviz*\bin\dot.exe''
    * Then in: ''c:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz*\bin\dot.exe''
  * On Linux/Mac OS-X :
    * Firstly in: ''/usr/local/bin/dot''
    * Then in: ''/usr/bin/dot''

====== Note for Mac users ======

You can easily install GraphViz by installing brew on your Mac machine. This could fix issues if you have installed GraphViz as .dmg package.

<code>
brew install libtool
brew link libtool
brew install graphviz
brew link --overwrite graphviz
</code>

====== Testing ======

To have information about where PlantUML expects to find dot, you can use the command line:
    java -jar plantuml.jar -testdot

You can also use this special diagram description:

<columns 100% 50% ->
<code>
@startuml
testdot
@enduml
</code>
<newcolumn>
<uml>
testdot
</uml>
</columns>
