<nodisp>TITLE: Integration with Eclipse</nodisp>
<nodisp>DESC: When the PlantUML Eclipse plugin is installed, a new special view PlantUML is available and displays the image of any text diagram edited in real time within Eclipse</nodisp>


===== Information about the PlantUML Eclipse Plugin =====


The Eclipse Plugin is developped and maintened by
[[http://www.ntnu.edu/employees/hal|Hallvard Tr√¶tteberg]]
(many thanks for his work!).

Like the core library PlantUML itself, it is //open source// and the plugin is distributed under EPL license.

The source code [[https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml|is hosted on GitHub]].


===== How to use it ? =====
First, you have to display the //PlantUML View// (click the //Window// menu):

{{:site:eclipse103.png?nolink|}}

This view displays automatically the class you are working on:

{{:site:eclipse104.png?nolink|}}

If you write some comment in //PlantUML language//, the corresponding diagram is automatically displayed.
And if you have several comments with diagrams, it selects the one the cursor is in.

In the //Preferences// Windows, you can also set up [[graphviz-dot|GraphViz path if needed]]:

{{:site:eclipse107.png?nolink|}}


===== How to install it ? =====


To install the plugin, you have to:
  * Go to **Help/Software Update/Find and install...** or **Help/Install new software...**
  * Create (if needed) or choose the following site as update site:\\ ''http://files.idi.ntnu.no/publish/plantuml/repository/''\\ {{:site:eclipse101.png?nolink|}}
  * Select PlantUML features:\\ {{:site:eclipse102.png?nolink|}}
  * Restart Eclipse

===== How to improve it ? =====

The plugin is not limited to Java source file, it also works with //Ecore/////Xcore//
files.

So that you can see the corresponding class diagram in a view side-by-side the //Ecore/////Xcore//
editor :

{{:site:xwordfeud-plantuml.png?nolink|}}

If you want to support other file types, you can implement a new extension to do so.
You can have a look at
[[https://github.com/hallvard/plantuml/tree/master/net.sourceforge.plantuml.xcore|the current xcore implementation]].
