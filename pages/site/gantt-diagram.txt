<nodisp>TITLE: Gantt Diagram syntax and features</nodisp>
<nodisp>DESC: PlantUML Gantt diagram syntax: Gantt diagrams are not fully supported within PlantUML. This is a draft version of the language can be subject to changes.</nodisp>

====== Gantt Diagram ======

__This is only a proposal and subject to change__.

You are very welcome [[http://forum.plantuml.net|to create a new discussion]] on this future syntax. Your feedbacks, ideas and suggestions help us to find the right solution.

The Gantt is described in //natural// language, using very simple sentences (subject-verb-complement). 

===== Declaring tasks =====

Tasks defined using square bracket. Their durations are defined using the ''last'' verb:

<columns 100% 50% ->
<code>
@startgantt
[Prototype design] lasts 15 days
[Test prototype] lasts 10 days
@endgantt
</code>
<newcolumn>
<uml title="simple UML timing diagram">
[Prototype design] lasts 15 days
[Test prototype] lasts 10 days
</uml>
</columns>

===== Adding constraints =====
It is possible to add constraints between task. 

<columns 100% 50% ->
<code>
@startgantt
[Prototype design] lasts 15 days
[Test prototype] lasts 10 days
[Test prototype] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
@endgantt
</code>
<newcolumn>
<uml title="simple UML timing diagram">
[Prototype design] lasts 15 days
[Test prototype] lasts 10 days
[Test prototype] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
</uml>
</columns>

<columns 100% 50% ->
<code>
@startgantt
[Prototype design] lasts 10 days
[Code prototype] lasts 10 days
[Write tests] lasts 5 days
[Code prototype] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Write tests] starts at [Code prototype]'s start
@endgantt
</code>
<newcolumn>
<uml title="simple UML timing diagram">
[Prototype design] lasts 10 days
[Code prototype] lasts 10 days
[Write tests] lasts 5 days
[Code prototype] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Write tests] starts at [Code prototype]'s start
</uml>
</columns>


===== Short names =====
It is possible to define short name for tasks with the ''as'' keyword. 

<columns 100% 50% ->
<code>
@startgantt
[Prototype design] as [D] lasts 15 days
[Test prototype] as [T] lasts 10 days
[T] starts at [D]'s end
@endgantt
</code>
<newcolumn>
<uml title="simple UML timing diagram">
[Prototype design] as [D] lasts 15 days
[Test prototype] as [T] lasts 10 days
[T] starts at [D]'s end
</uml>
</columns>


===== Customize colors =====
It also possible to customize [[https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp|colors]]. 

<columns 100% 50% ->
<code>
@startgantt
[Prototype design] lasts 13 days
[Test prototype] lasts 4 days
[Test prototype] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Prototype design] is colored in Fuchsia/FireBrick 
[Test prototype] is colored in GreenYellow/Green 
@endgantt
</code>
<newcolumn>
<uml title="simple UML timing diagram">
[Prototype design] lasts 13 days
[Test prototype] lasts 4 days
[Test prototype] starts at [Prototype design]'s end
[Prototype design] is colored in Fuchsia/FireBrick 
[Test prototype] is colored in GreenYellow/Green 
</uml>
</columns>


===== Milestone =====
You can define Milestones using the ''happens'' verb. 

<columns 100% 50% ->
<code>
@startgantt
[Test prototype] lasts 10 days
[Prototype completed] happens at [Test prototype]'s end
[Setup assembly line] lasts 12 days
[Setup assembly line] starts at [Test prototype]'s end
@endgantt
</code>
<newcolumn>
<uml title="simple UML timing diagram">
[Test prototype] lasts 10 days
[Prototype completed] happens at [Test prototype]'s end
[Setup assembly line] lasts 12 days
[Setup assembly line] starts at [Test prototype]'s end
</uml>
</columns>


===== Calendar =====
You can specify a starting date for the whole project. By default, the first task starts at this date. 

<columns 100% 50% ->
<code>
@startgantt
Project starts the 20th of september 2017
[Prototype design] as [TASK1] lasts 13 days
[TASK1] is colored in Lavender/LightBlue
@endgantt
</code>
<newcolumn>
<uml title="simple UML timing diagram">
Project starts the 20th of september 2017
[Prototype design] as [TASK1] lasts 13 days
[TASK1] is colored in Lavender/LightBlue
</uml>
</columns>


===== Complex example =====
It also possible to use the ''and'' conjunction.

You can also add delays in constraints. 

<code>
@startgantt
[Prototype design] lasts 13 days and is colored in Lavender/LightBlue
[Test prototype] lasts 9 days and is colored in Coral/Green and starts 3 days after [Prototype design]'s end
[Write tests] lasts 5 days and ends at [Prototype design]'s end
[Hire tests writers] lasts 6 days and ends at [Write tests]'s start
[Init and write tests report] is colored in Coral/Green
[Init and write tests report] starts 1 day before [Test prototype]'s start and ends at [Test prototype]'s end
@endgantt
</code>

<uml title="simple UML timing diagram">
[Prototype design] lasts 13 days and is colored in Lavender/LightBlue
[Test prototype] lasts 9 days and is colored in Coral/Green and starts 3 days after [Prototype design]'s end
[Write tests] lasts 5 days and ends at [Prototype design]'s end
[Hire tests writers] lasts 6 days and ends at [Write tests]'s start
[Init and write tests report] is colored in Coral/Green
[Init and write tests report] starts 1 day before [Test prototype]'s start and ends at [Test prototype]'s end
</uml>
