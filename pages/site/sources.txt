<nodisp>TITLE: Embedded diagrams into source code</nodisp>
<nodisp>DESC: It is possible to embed PlantUML text diagram into any programming language source code. Just put your diagrams into comments with @startuml and @enduml.</nodisp>


====== How and where diagrams can be written ======
Each diagram description begins with the keyword ''@startuml''
then ends with the keyword ''@enduml''.

You can refer to [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/plantuml/files/PlantUML%20Language%20Reference%20Guide.pdf/download|the PlantUML Language Reference Guide]].

Those descriptions may be included into :
  * 	Text files (**.txt**),
  * 	Html files (**.html** or **.htm**),
  * 	[[javadoc|Java sources files]] (**.java**),
  * 	C/C++ source files (**.c**, **.h**, **.cpp**)
  * 	LaTeX sources files (**.tex**),
  * 	[[http://maven.apache.org/doxia/references/apt-format.html|APT files(.apt)]]
  * 	[[word|Word files(**.doc**)]]
  * 	[[server|URL]]


Of course, if you use Html, LaTeX, APT or Java/C/C++ files, you should put
diagram descriptions into comments.

===== File naming =====

By default, ''.png'' file have the same name as the source file used to generated them (only the extension changes).

An automatic sequence is added if a source file contains several instances of ''@startXXX''.

It is possible to use a different file name for the generated file. For example:

<code>
@startuml image.png
Alice->Bob: Authentication Request
Bob-->Alice: Authentication Response
@enduml
</code>

In this example, the ''.png'' file will be named ''image.png''.

(Please note that you should not use this feature with //Word// integration.)
