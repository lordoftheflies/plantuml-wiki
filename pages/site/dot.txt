<nodisp>TITLE: Integration of Dot diagrams</nodisp>
<nodisp>DESC: Graphviz/Dot is a nice open source graph visualization software. It take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language. Dot syntax has been integrated into PlantUML.</nodisp>

====== Generalisation ======
Up to now, diagrams descriptions have to start with ''@startuml'' and to finish with ''@enduml''.
**PlantUML** will allow in some future to generate other diagrams than UML, and in that cases,
''@startuml'' would not make sense anymore.

So, the general convention is changed to let diagrams descriptions start with ''@startXXX''
and to finish with ''@endXXX'', where ''XXX'' has to be changed with the type of diagrams.
Of course, ''XXX'' is changed ''uml'' for all existing diagrams, so that compatibility is not break.

Note that ''XXX'' could be any strings of characters.

This means that plugin developers are encouraged to change their code to recognize ''@start'' instead of ''@startuml''

====== DOT ======

Since **PlantUML** uses [[http://www.graphviz.org/Gallery.php|Graphviz/DOT]],
it is possible to directly use DOT language.


This means that you can use Graphviz/DOT with all tools that support **PlantUML**.

Note that the very first line has to be: ''digraph XXXX {''
You can also use ''@startuml/@enduml'' instead of ''@startdot/@enddot''.

Here is a working example:
<columns 100% 50% ->
<code>
@startuml
digraph foo {
  node [style=rounded]
  node1 [shape=box]
  node2 [fillcolor=yellow, style="rounded,filled", shape=diamond]
  node3 [shape=record, label="{ a | b | c }"]

  node1 -> node2 -> node3
}
@enduml
</code>
<newcolumn>
<uml title="foo">
digraph foo {
  node [style=rounded]
  node1 [shape=box]
  node2 [fillcolor=yellow, style="rounded,filled", shape=diamond]
  node3 [shape=record, label="{ a | b | c }"]

  node1 -> node2 -> node3
}
</uml>
</columns>

<columns 100% 50% ->
<code>
@startuml
digraph foo {
 PlantUML -> Dot [label=use];
}
@enduml
</code>
<newcolumn>
<uml title="foo">
digraph foo {
 PlantUML -> Dot [label=use];
}
</uml>
</columns>

Only PNG generation is supported now.
