<nodisp>TITLE: Porting Graphviz To Java</nodisp>
<nodisp>DESC: Some work has been started to port GraphViz to Java so that you can run PlantUML without having to install GraphViz first.</nodisp>


===== The context =====
PlantUML uses Graphviz/DOT to compute node positionning for every UML diagrams (except Sequence Diagrams and Activity Beta Diagrams).
The fact that DOT computes automatically the position of node is a key feature, and algorithms implemented in
DOT usually give very good result.

However, there are some drawbacks of using DOT :
the computation is done by an external program (dot.exe on Windows, dot on linux), and that means that :

  *     PlantUML has to create a new process for each diagram, (and communication with this new process could be source of bugs).
  *     Users have to install DOT on their system, in addition of Java.
  *     PlantUML is not fully portable. 

Another way of using DOT would be to use it as a library, and to link it with PlantUML using JNI
(Java Native Interface) but that would not be perfect thought.


If a Java version of Graphviz/DOT would exist, this would allow to greatly simplify the installation and the use of PlantUML.
So we have started a port from C to Java of GraphViz/DOT source code: see [[https://github.com/plantuml/smetana|Smetana project]]

===== Alpha version =====

Smetana code has been integrated into PlantUML, so you can use the ''!pragma graphviz_dot jdot'' directive
to force PlantUML to use the internal Java port of GraphViz/Dot, instead of the regular dot process.


<columns 100% 50% ->
<code>
@startuml
!pragma graphviz_dot jdot
class Foo1

Foo1 --> Foo2
Foo1 --> Foo3
Foo1 ---> Foo4 : test 4
Foo1 ----> Foo5 : test 5

@enduml
</code>
<newcolumn>
<uml title="foo">
!pragma graphviz_dot jdot
class Foo1

Foo1 --> Foo2
Foo1 --> Foo3
Foo1 ---> Foo4 : test 4
Foo1 ----> Foo5 : test 5

</uml>
</columns>

As you can see, some feature are not implemented yet (drawing of arrow heads, for example).

Performance is not very good, but this is only an alpha version.

**The key point is that this image has been generated without launching Graphviz/DOT!**
