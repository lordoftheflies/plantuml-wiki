<nodisp>TITLE: Integration with Javadoc documentation tool</nodisp>
<nodisp>DESC: You can integrate PlantUML diagrams into Javadoc comments. The corresponding images will be automatically generated and included in your documentation.</nodisp>


====== New Doclet ======
A new enhanced doclet (written by Gerald Boersma) is now available.

It has much more option than the legacy previous one.

You will find [[https://github.com/gboersma/uml-java-doclet|detailed instructions here.]]

====== Legacy Javadoc ======
When the javadoc tools build the documentation, it copies all files
included in the ''doc-files'' directory to the javadoc . (see [[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html|How to Write Doc Comments for the Javadoc Tool]]).

You can take advantage of this feature like this:

<code>
package net.demo1;
/**
* Demonstration for PlantUML.
* <p>
* Example of use:
* <p>
* <img src="doc-files/image1.png">
*/
/*
* @startuml doc-files/image1.png
* Bob -> Alice : hello
* Alice --> Bob : OK
* @enduml
*/
public class Demo1 {

}
</code>

If you run **PlantUML** before the Javadoc, it will generate ''image1.png''
in the directory ''doc-files'' .

Then, when you launch the Javadoc tool, you will have the following result:

{{:site:javadoc01.png?nolink|}}

Note that the definition of the image itself is in a non-javadoc
comment, so that it is not exported to HTML.

As you can see, adding UML diagrams into java documentation is now really easy.
