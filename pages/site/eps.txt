<nodisp>TITLE: Generation of EPS Encapsulated PostScript file</nodisp>
<nodisp>DESC: PlantUML can generate images using EPS format. Those file can be integrated in LaTeX or PDF documents with a better result than PNG files, because EPS is a scalable format.</nodisp>


===== EPS =====
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulated_PostScript|EPS]] is
a graphical format which is scalable. It means that when you zoom an
image, you don't loose quality. So this format gives good printing
result.


===== EPS Support =====
You can enable it by using ''-teps'' flag with the [[command-line|command line]].

You can also use ''format="eps"'' in the [[ant-task|ant task definition]].
<code>
<target name="main">
<plantuml dir="./src" format="eps" />
</target>
</code>
