<nodisp>TITLE: UML in Microsoft Word with the Word Add-in</nodisp>
<nodisp>DESC: When the PlantUML Word Add-in is installed, a new bar PlantUML is available and allows you to put directly UML diagrams into your Word documents. Just click a button to update your diagram.</nodisp>

====== Word Add-in ======
Adriaan van den Brand has made many improvements to the Word Add-in.

He has created a Word Template that allows a very good integration between //Word// and PlantUML and better performance.

With this Word Add-in, a new bar will be available within Word:

{{:site:word_bar1.png?nolink|}}

By click on //"Preferences"//, you can now choose to use EPS instead of PNG for diagrams to improve print quality
(because EPS is a vector image format.)

This template allows using PlantUML directly from //MS Word 2010// without need to alter document templates
or edit VBA macro's. //MS Word Versions 2007// and //2013// might work, but are not tested.

Everything is documented in the template itself, that you can
[[https://github.com/plantuml/word-template|download here]].

Many thanks for his works!

The macro searches the ''plantuml.jar'' file in that order:

  * In the same directory as your document
  * Then, in the parent directory of this directory
  * Then, in the parent directory of the parent... up to the root folder
  * Then, in the same directory as the ''normal.dot'' file
  * Then, in the parent directory of this directory
  * Then, in the parent directory of the parent... up to the root folder

If the ''plantuml.jar'' file is not found, a box display the list of all searched directories.
