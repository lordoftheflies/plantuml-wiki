====== The Oregon Trail ======

The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(video_game)|Oregon Trail]] is a //very old// game created
in 1971.

A version from [[http://www.atariarchives.org/bca|David Ahl's]] (named as
[[http://www.atariarchives.org/bca/Chapter02_WestwardHo.php|Westward Ho!]] for some reasons)
has been ported to Java and integrated in **PlantUML**...

===== Let's play =====

To launch the game, you will have to use the good old ''RUN'' Basic command :
<columns 100% 50% ->
<code>
@startuml
run oregon trail
@enduml
</code>
<newcolumn>
<uml title="foo">
run oregon trail
</uml>
</columns>

Every input has to be added in the text file:

<columns 100% 50% ->
<code>
@startuml
run oregon trail
150
@enduml
</code>
<newcolumn>
<uml title="foo">
run oregon trail
150
</uml>
</columns>

Every input has to be added in the text file:

<columns 100% 50% ->
<code>
@startuml
run oregon trail
150
100
10
40

@enduml
</code>
<newcolumn>
<uml title="foo">
run oregon trail
150
100
10
40

</uml>
</columns>

For shooting, you will have to type **as fast as possible**
the word printed on the screen (//like in the original version!//).

<columns 100% 50% ->
<code>
@startuml
