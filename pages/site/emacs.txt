<nodisp>TITLE: Integration with Emacs</nodisp>
<nodisp>DESC: You can use PlantUML with Emacs org-mode. It is also possible to edit, render, preview PlantUML diagrams from Emacs.</nodisp>

There are several ways to use PlantUML and Emacs together :

===== Emacs =====
[[http://twitter.com/lucagreco|Luca Greco]] has started a set of
[[http://gist.github.com/547521|helpers to edit, render, preview PlantUML code from Emacs]].

===== Org-Babel =====
[[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel|Org-Babel]] now
supports [[http://eschulte.github.com/babel-dev/DONE-integrate-plantuml-support.html|blocks of plantuml code]].

There is also an [[http://zhangweize.wordpress.com/2010/09/20/update-plantuml-mode|Emacs mode for PlantUML]]

Thanks to [[http://zhangweize.wordpress.com/2010/08/25/creating-uml-images-by-using-plantuml-and-org-babel-in-emacs|Zhang Weize]] for adding this support.
===== Emacs Org-Mode =====
You can also use PlantUML with [[http://orgmode.org|Emacs org-mode]].

You will find the needed macro at the following address [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IanYang|http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IanYang]]

Once installed, embed PlantUML code in Emacs org-mode is used
like this:
<code>
#+BEGIN_UML
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response
#+END_UML
</code>
While the org file is exported to HTML or other formats, PlantUML is called to generate image and replace the block in place.

Thanks to Ian Yang for the work done.
