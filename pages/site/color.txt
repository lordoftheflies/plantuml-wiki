<nodisp>**TITLE**: Choosing colors</nodisp>

<nodisp>**DESC**: You can print all color names available in PlantUML and also display a palette of colors close to some predefined one.</nodisp>

===== Colors =====
You can use specify a color either:
  * with [[https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp|its standard name]]
  * using HEX value ''#AABBCC''
  * using short HEX value ''#ABC''

A user has recently created an image to display [[https://github.com/sledgeh/PlantUML-colors|all names colors used by PlantUML]]. (We thank him by the way!)

So a new feature has been added to print all those colors using a special diagram description:
<code>
@startuml
colors
@enduml
</code>
<uml title="List all colors">
colors
</uml>

It is also possible to print a palette of colors close to some other color (using its name or HEX value).

<code>
@startuml
colors chocolate
@enduml
</code>

<uml title="Colors palette">
colors chocolate
</uml>
