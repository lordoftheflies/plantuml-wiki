<nodisp>TITLE: Support of XMI</nodisp>
<nodisp>DESC: XML is a XML format that theorically allows to interchange data between programs. PlantUML provides alpha support for XMI files, for basic interoperability with ArgoUML and StarUML.</nodisp>

====== XMI ======

Many users ask for [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Metadata_Interchange|XMI]]
support in PlantUML. So the ''-xmi'' flag has been added in the
command line (and in the ANT task also), for betatesting. This is only
working with class diagrams.

As explain on the [[http://modeling-languages.com/|Modeling Portal]], XMI [[http://modeling-languages.com/blog/content/xmi-nightmares-argouml-xmi-format-change|theorically]]
allows to interchange data between programs.

So let's have a very simple example, with three classes:
<columns 100% 50% ->
<code>
@startuml
class class1 {
  field
}
class1 - class2
class2 - class3
@enduml
</code>
<newcolumn>
<uml title="foo">
class class1 {
  field
}
class1 - class2
class2 - class3
</uml>
</columns>
Imagine that you can have a XMI file that allows to import this on
severals UML tools. It would be nice.

Unfortunalty, having the very same file is difficult. For
example,
  * On [[http://staruml.sourceforge.net/en|StarUML]], you have to use [[testStarUML.xml|testStarUML.xmi]]
  * On [[http://argouml.tigris.org|ArgoUML]], you have to use [[testArgoUML.xml|testArgoUML.xmi]]
If someone manages to have an identical file that would work on both
tools, please post it there : **you will have a free licence of PlantUML :-)**

So, they are actually 3 flags:
  * ''-xmi'' : only classes are exported, without any relationship. This is very basic but should work with on many tools
  * ''-xmi:argo'' : to be read by [[http://argouml.tigris.org|ArgoUML]]
  * ''-xmi:star'' : to be read by [[http://staruml.sourceforge.net/en|StarUML]]
Please note that this is an alpha version, and that many things will probably not work. [[http://forum.plantuml.net/|You should use the forum to ask for corrections.]]
