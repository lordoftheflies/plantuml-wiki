**TITLE**: The servlet for server side

**DESC**: It is possible to install PlantUML as a web server to generate image on-the-fly. Installation must be done into a J2EE servlet container (like Tomcat or Jetty).

====== PlantUML Server ======

You can use PlantUML using the online web service to generate images on-the-fly. A online demonstration is available at [[http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml|http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml]], but you can also [[#Installation of the PlantUML Server|install]] it on your own JEE web application server.

====== Interactive interface ======

The big input field is used to enter your diagram description. You can type in any diagram description, then press the submit button and the diagram will be displayed below.
It's a good practice to start your diagram by the ''@startxxx'' keyword.

When you validate the diagram, you are redirected to an encoded URL encoding your diagram. The [[text-encoding|encoded form]] is a convenient way to share your diagrams with others because it's shorter than the many lines of a diagram and it can be easily displayed in a browser using the online PlantUML Server.

For example, ''SyfFKj2rKt3CoKnELR1Io4ZDoSa70000'' is the encoded form of:

<code>
@startuml
Bob -> Alice : hello
@enduml 
</code>

====== Specify an initial diagram ======

By default, the PlantUML Server shows the well-known ''Bob -> Alice'' sample but it's easy to invoke it with an other diagram using its encoded form.
Just append ''/uml/ENCODED'' to the URL.

For example, this link [[http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/Aov9B2hXil98pSd9LoZFByf9iUOgBial0000|http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/Aov9B2hXil98pSd9LoZFByf9iUOgBial0000]] opens the PlantUML Server with a simple Hello World activity diagram.

====== Metadata ======

PlantUML saves the diagram's source code in the generated PNG Metadata in the form of [[text-encoding|encoded text]]. So it is possible to retrieve this source by using the query parameter ''metadata'', giving it some image URL.

For example, if you want to retrieve the diagram's source of the image [[http://i.stack.imgur.com/HJvKF.png|http://i.stack.imgur.com/HJvKF.png]], use the following server request: [[http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/?metadata=http://i.stack.imgur.com/HJvKF.png|http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/?metadata=http://i.stack.imgur.com/HJvKF.png]].

Sounds like magic! No, merely clever engineering :-)
====== Web service mode ======

The web service interface of the PlantUML Server is dedicated to developers. 

===== PNG service =====

To get a PNG file of a diagram, use the following URL scheme:
[[http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png/SyfFKj2rKt3CoKnELR1Io4ZDoSa70000|/plantuml/png/ENCODED]]

===== SVG service =====

To get a SVG XML file of a diagram, use the following URL scheme:
[[http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/svg/SyfFKj2rKt3CoKnELR1Io4ZDoSa70000|/plantuml/svg/ENCODED]]

> Note that not all diagrams can be produced in [[svg|SVG]]. For example, [[ditaa|ditaa diagrams]] are only available in PNG format.

===== ASCII Art service =====

To get an ASCII Art representation of a diagram, encoded in UTF-8, use the following URL scheme:
[[http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/txt/SyfFKj2rKt3CoKnELR1Io4ZDoSa70000|/plantuml/txt/ENCODED]]

Note that only sequence diagrams can be produced in ASCII Art.

===== Image Map service =====

To get the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_map#Pure_HTML|client image map]] related to a previously generated PNG image, use the following URL scheme:
[[http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/map/AqWiAibCpYn8p2jHSCfFKeYEpYWfAR3IroylBzSho04Ab-Rcw2NdvyR6Se7aTUqK77CoarCLh11AuSgAyqkBabFJyelIK_NoKajYOnKoKdDoyW40|/plantuml/map/ENCODED]]

The output is a list of ''<area>'' tags, each line matching a link present in the diagram description.

For example, the following [[http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/SoWkIImgAStDuIe0qfd9cGM9UIKAJlb92j7H6IKb1LRw-WKvG26W2hta_DpOM2wGdAwTWcDEPdAgWXL2MLf-KMck7bnnNcf9RAn2HcfEJZwNGsfU2iWA0000|diagram]]:
<code>
@startuml
participant Bob [[http://plantuml.com]]
Bob -> Alice : [[http://forum.plantuml.net]] hello
@enduml
</code>

produces the [[http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/map/AqWiAibCpYn8p2jHSCfFKeYEpYWfAR3Iro_80GgLvkRe9UVdniPoWUHqxHGSSpAJKnMi4ChIyejAS_NWYlDIIs9Z5J9IStBo0G00|following output]]:
<code>
<map id="plantuml_map" name="plantuml_map">
<area shape="rect" id="id1" href="http://forum.plantuml.net" title="http://forum.plantuml.net" alt="" coords="38,50,199,65"/>
<area shape="rect" id="id2" href="http://plantuml.com" title="http://plantuml.com" alt="" coords="8,3,50,116"/>
</map>
</code>

Note that you need to include these ''<area...'' tags inside a ''<map...'' html tag to make the complete image map.

===== Proxy service =====

With the proxy service, the source description of the diagram can be fetched by the PlantUML Server from a remote document.

The proxy service uses the following URL scheme:
''/plantuml/proxy?idx=INDEX&src=RESOURCE''

  * INDEX is optional, it specifies the occurrence (starting at 0) of the diagram description that will be parsed when there are more than one diagram descriptions in the remote document. It defaults to zero.
  * RESOURCE is the complete URL of the document which contains the diagram description (with the ''@startxxx'' and ''@endxxx'' tags), it could be a ''.html'' or a ''.txt'' file. 

For example, try this link:
[[http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?src=https://raw.github.com/plantuml/plantuml-server/master/src/main/webapp/resource/test2diagrams.txt|http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?src=https://raw.github.com/plantuml/plantuml-server/master/src/main/webapp/resource/test2diagrams.txt]]

Note that the address of the remote document is specified as a parameter, so it is not necessary to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urlencode|URL encode]] the URL.

====== Installation of the PlantUML Server ======

To install PlantUML Server on your own JEE 5 web server, download the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/plantuml/files/plantuml.war/download|plantuml.war]] file and copy it on the //webapp// folder of your server.

PlantUML Server have been successfully tested on Tomcat 6 and 7 and Jetty 8 and 9.

===== Source code =====

PlantUML Server is open source, the code is available on [[https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml-server|GitHub]].

(The main source is at [[https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml|https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml]])
