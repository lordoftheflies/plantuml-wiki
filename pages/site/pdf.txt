<nodisp>TITLE: Generation of PDF file</nodisp>
<nodisp>DESC: PlantUML can generate images using PDF format. External libraries like Batik and FOP are need for that. All necessaries files are listed here.</nodisp>


===== PDF Support =====

Some users have asked for the ability to generate diagrams directly in PDF format.
Unfortunalty, this is not an easy task, and would require the need of several external libraries ([[http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik|Batik]] and [[http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop|FOP]]).

This goes against the wish to keep ''plantuml.jar'' file not too big and to facilitate its integration with other products.

Fortunatly, it is possible to use some kind of //dynamic// linkage, so that those libraries
are not needed for compilation or execution if not present. A SVG file is first generated, then translated to PDF.

Note that in some case, shadowing is an issue for PDF export, [[http://forum.plantuml.net/1026/instruction-how-enable-pdf-support-seems-not-correct-anymore|so you can find here a way to disable it]].

===== Make it works =====
So by default PDF generation is not enable. This will probably fit majority of users' needs.

If you want to use PDF, you have to download the following files:

  * avalon-framework-4.2.0.jar
  * batik-all-1.7.jar
  * commons-io-1.3.1.jar
  * commons-logging-1.0.4.jar
  * fop.jar
  * xml-apis-ext-1.3.04.jar
  * xmlgraphics-commons-1.4.jar


You have to download those files from [[http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik|Batik]] and [[http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop|FOP]] web site.

For testing purpose only, those files have been put together in a zip [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/p68jqt29x3asppv/batikAndFop.zip?dl=0|here]].

Those files have to be in the very same folder as ''plantuml.jar'' (this is important)

Now, you can use the ''-pdf'' flag in the command line:

    java -jar plantuml.jar -pdf diagram.txt

Or ''format="pdf"'' in the ant task:

<code>
<!-- task definition -->
<taskdef name="plantuml" classname="net.sourceforge.plantuml.ant.PlantUmlTask" classpath="plantuml.jar" />
<!-- process diagram.txt file -->
<target name="images">
<plantuml format="pdf">
<fileset file="diagram.txt" />
</plantuml>
</target>
</code>
