<nodisp>TITLE: Standalone tool usage</nodisp>
<nodisp>DESC: PlantUML can be used as standalone tool. Just double-click on the jar file. You will be asked for some existing directory: PlantUML will process any diagrams from there.</nodisp>


====== GUI ======
If the double-click does not work fine, you can try the following command:

<code>
java -jar plantuml.jar -gui
</code>

You can then select a directory that will be periodically
scanned by **PlantUML**.

The following window lists all images that are generated by **PlantUML**.
If any modification is done in the directory, the window will be updated.

{{:site:choice_rep.png?nolink|}}

You can iconify the window while you are creating or changing
files into the chosen directory.

You can also double-click on an image title to have a look at it.
If the source file of the diagram is modified, the image will be
automatically updated.
